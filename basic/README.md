# Basic Template

This is a minimal starting point for building an event-driven, async-first workflow using [llama-index-workflows](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-index-workflows).

## Installation

Install project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Run the workflow from the command line:

```bash
python -m basic.workflow
```

You should see a friendly hello message. Edit `src/basic/workflow.py` to add your own steps and logic.
